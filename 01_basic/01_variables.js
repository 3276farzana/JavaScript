const account=978973;
let email='far32@gmail.com';
var name="farz";
acc_city='busan';
let accstate;

// why don't we use var anymore? it's because js didn't know anything about functional and block scope before so if u worte name anywhere else it will change the name everywhere
// with table we can wrote multiple variable together in console
console.table([account,email,name,acc_city]);
